# 学习工具

## 网易有道翻译

推荐安装，不收费。启动以后，只要选中就会自动显示选中词或句子的中文含义。就不用每个词都做记录了。

一般只有词典自动显示的词义和实际意思不符合时，才需要人工记录含义。



# 学习方法

看美剧时不明白的词汇会记录到此文档中。刚录入时，忘记数，记次数皆为空。隔天会对这类词汇进行复习。

每日持续复习所有还没记住的词汇。如果忘记词义则忘记数+1，如果记住则记住数+1。如果忘记发音则2个都+1。

记住数要大于忘记数3次以上（包含）才会停止复习。第1遍就记住的词汇也会停止复习。

中文含义记录在表格最后一列，避免复习时直接看到词义。

时间字段，记录词汇在美剧中出现的位置。个别翻译软件的翻译或者发音和美剧中的不一致才会记录。
